# Social-Distancing-App
This app alerts users when their social distance is endangered.

# What is Social Distancing App for Workplace?
As experts say that the simplest way to avoid spreading this deadly virus is through maintaining social distance, the goal of this app is to alert you whenever your social distance is endangered.  Let's say, you are at your workplace where you get to meet new and old people every day. You can't avoid meetings but you can certainly maintain your social distance to keep yourself out of trouble. 

# How does it work?
This app turns on your Bluetooth and scans other devices in the range of 2 meters. If it finds one, it will alert you immediately to maintain your distance. Android 7.1 and below won't require this app to be installed on the other devices. However, in the case of Android 8 and above, it will require other Android devices to have installed this app because doing that turns on their discoverability that helps your app to find them, and alerts them. Of course, this app is especially for the workplace, so it would help everyone to install this app in their Android device which will turn on their discoverability.

# Who is this app targeted to?
This app is especially designed for the workplace.

Disclaimer: The app isn't reliable at alerting users after Android 7.1. However, I haven't been able to test it on other versions as I have only one physical device.
